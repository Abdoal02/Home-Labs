# Group Policy Enforcement Lab

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation and enforcement of Group Policy Objects (GPOs) in an Active Directory environment using OU-based targeting.  
The goal is to show hands-on experience with AD, user and computer scoping, and enterprise-style policy enforcement.

## Lab Setup
- Windows Server Domain Controller (AD DS)
- Windows Client VM joined the domain
- Organizational Unit (OU) created for scoped policy enforcement
- Domain user created inside the OU for testing

## Policies Implemented
- **Password Complexity**  
  Enforced minimum 8-character passwords with complexity requirements.

- **Account Lockout Policy**  
  Accounts lock after 5 failed login attempts for 30 minutes.

- **Control Panel and Settings Restriction**  
  Standard domain users cannot access the Control Panel or PC Settings. Administrators retain full access.

## Validation
- Domain users were prompted to change passwords on first login.  
- Account lockout triggered after multiple failed login attempts.  
- Control Panel access is blocked for standard users while remaining accessible to administrators.  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Active Directory administration  
- Organizational Unit design and policy scoping  
- Group Policy creation, linking, and enforcement  
- User vs computer policy application  
- Troubleshooting GPO precedence and policy refresh timing  
- Enterprise-style access control
